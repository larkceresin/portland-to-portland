### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images

**Intro**
This project is working out grid, flex layouts that are adaptive and somewhat responsive as well. 
This is a project about traveling across the US. (but really only mentions states in the North East)
This will likely not be finished to include other states one would pass through on this journey, but may!

I'm learning and using BEM for structure of this project. 

**Figma**

* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lNsn9aE1Be6bvg9FeAzRXT/Sprint-3-From-Portland-to-Portland-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)
This is being used to showcase what I'm looking to make this site appear to look like on multiple screen sizes.

**Images**

Exported images directly from Figma, to be as if I'm getting them directly from the designer through there. I had to compress pictures as well so they would take up less space.
