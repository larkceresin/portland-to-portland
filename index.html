Near to the Atlantic ocean, covered in state parks, with lots of history: Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to miss.</p>
                        <p class="state__paragraph">Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings! Maine is also known for their Maine Lobsters, which used to be so plentiful they used them as bait for other fish (If only we knew better then)</p>

Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.</p>
                        <p class="state__paragraph">This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of transmitting energy.</p>

Lights are always on, and there's always something going on everywhere. Time Square is known for where the ball drops to welcome the new year (The ball is up all year), so you could stop by to see it. There's many stores if you enjoy shopping, and lots of great restaurants for food.  </p>
